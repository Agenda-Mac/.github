## What is Agenda?  

**Agenda** is an elegant **date-oriented note-taking and task management app** designed to bring structure to your projects and daily planning. Combining the power of a calendar with the flexibility of a notes editor, it helps you stay on top of your schedule while documenting your thoughts and progress over time.  

Unlike traditional planners, Agenda connects your notes directly to specific dates and calendar events. This allows you to track ideas, meetings, and goals with full context â€” so you always know whatâ€™s upcoming and whatâ€™s been completed.  

Agenda syncs seamlessly with **Apple Calendar and Reminders**, letting you link notes to events, set reminders, and manage timelines without switching between apps. Perfect for professionals, students, and creatives, itâ€™s a productivity hub that keeps your work organized, contextual, and beautifully designed.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon**, Agenda runs smoothly across all modern Mac devices. With support for Markdown formatting, project tagging, and real-time sync, it provides a clean, distraction-free environment for planning and writing â€” helping you stay productive with purpose.
